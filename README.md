Phishing Detection & Awareness Report

Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the Future Interns Cybersecurity Internship (Task 2). The goal was to perform a technical audit of real-world phishing emails, identify social engineering indicators, and provide actionable prevention guidelines for users.

Analyzed Examples

  1.Norton Brand Impersonation: Detected via sender mismatch (newslettertdn@bluemooncaterers.com) and artificial urgency.
  
  2.Cloud Storage Threat: Analyzed for "Loss Aversion" tactics where the attacker threatened permanent data deletion.
  
  3.PayPal Financial Fraud: Identified through the use of fake reference numbers and strict 48-hour deadlines to bypass user critical thinking.
 
Tools & Methodology

 •	Data Collection: Sourced raw samples from public repositories like phishing_pot.
 
 •	Technical Analysis: Utilized Google Admin Toolbox for email header inspection and SPF/DKIM verification.
 
 •	Risk Classification: Categorized threats based on their potential for credential harvesting and financial loss.

Prevention Guidelines

 •	Verify sender domains by inspecting the full email address.
 
 •	Hover over links to check the true destination URL before clicking.
 
 •	Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all sensitive accounts.
